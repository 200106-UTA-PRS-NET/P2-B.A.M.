Project 2, an event planning application.

Project Synopsis:
	Our application, Booking Boogie (Working Title), is an event planning site that allows venues to schedule performances with a variety of entertainers. For example, a local coffee shop can use the site to find and schedule a local jazz band to perform on Valentines day. A venue will be able to register and log on to the website, where they will be given the chance to choose a performer from a list. 
	These performers are able to register with this site as well, and each performer can specify their type of performance, their demographic, their hourly rate, and any additional tags to help them stand out. Venues will be able to specify what theyâ€™re looking for in a performer by inputting different tags, allowing the venue to browse a list of the best possible performers for the position. Once a venue finds a performer it likes the starting time and duration are recorded, and the total cost of the performance is calculated.
	The venue and the performer will be allowed to update their information at any point. Venues and Performers will be able to view their event history, which can assist in finding good recommendations for future events.
	
The technologies and environments used include:
	C#, ASP.NET Core Restful Service, Azure SQL Database, Azure App Services, Azure DevOps with Azure Pipelines, Newton (External Calculator API), Entity Framework Core, HTML, CSS, Typescript with Angular, Swagger, SonarCloud, Docker, Postman, XUnit Test project, Jasmine, Karma.
